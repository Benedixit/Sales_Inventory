# Sales_Inventory

The dataset was obtained from maven analytics website. It aimed to find answers to the following
1. Company with the highest profit
2. Category with the highest profit
3. Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
4. Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
5. Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
6. How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

An understanding of views, joins and subqueries was enhanced from this project. In the author's opinion, views are preferable to subqueries as sql performance is increased.
